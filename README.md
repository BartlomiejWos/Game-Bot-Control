# STM32F429I Game Bot Control 

## This microcontroller program serves as the client for game server. Player boards (STM32F429I-DISC1) connect through TCP/IP, utilizing the Ethernet port. Requests and responses are transmitted as AMCOM packets through the TCP socket.

Project involves:
* AMCOM Protocol Library
* Implemented game bot control within the main.c 
* Game Server Communication:
